Welcome!
------
I am a PhD candidate in UC San Diego's computer science [theory group](https://cstheory.ucsd.edu/home.html),
where I am extremely fortuate to be advised by [Daniel M. Kane](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dakane/) and 
[Shachar Lovett](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~slovett/home.html). I completed my undergraduate studies at the 
University of Maryland, College Park.

My research interests lie in theoretical computer science and combinatorics. Most of my recent work has been in
communication complexity, additive combinatorics, and the complexity of sampling in weak models of computation.
